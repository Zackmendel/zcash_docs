# Testnet Guide

The Zcash testnet is an alternative blockchain that attempts to mimic
the main Zcash network for testing purposes. Testnet coins are distinct
from actual ZEC and do not have value. Developers and users can
experiment with the testnet without having to use valuable currency. The
testnet is also used to test network upgrades and their activation
before committing to the upgrade on the main Zcash network.

## Joining

In order to use the testnet, you must:

`arrow-circle-right` Follow the `user_guide` to install a Zcash node

`arrow-circle-right` Set the `ugConfiguration` for your node to sync
with testnet (and optionally mine testnet coins)

## Using

`arrow-circle-right` Obtain testnet coins (TAZ)  
Join our [Discord Support](https://discord.gg/GGtsUzyp) and ask how to
obtain some TAZ or try a [faucet](https://faucet.zecpages.com/)
