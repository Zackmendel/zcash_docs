# Binary Tarball Download & Setup

The Electric Coin Company provides a binary tarball for download.

As of v6.10.0, We are no longer supporting Debian 10(Buster) packages in
apt.

[Download Tarball for Debian Bullseye
v6.10.0](https://download.z.cash/downloads/zcash-6.10.0-linux64-debian-bullseye.tar.gz)

After downloading but before extracting, verify that the checksum of the
tarball matches the hash below for the version of the binary you
downloaded:

Debian Bullseye:

``` bash
sha256sum zcash-6.10.0-linux64-debian-bullseye.tar.gz
```

Result:
`4c59f3a83f61c01f753b653c2780b3dfb9f65af93a7815ff6bd784c326f773e8`

[Download Tarball for Debian Bookworm
v6.10.0](https://download.z.cash/downloads/zcash-6.10.0-linux64-debian-bookworm.tar.gz)

After downloading but before extracting, verify that the checksum of the
tarball matches the hash below for the version of the binary you
downloaded:

Debian Bookworm:

``` bash
sha256sum zcash-6.10.0-linux64-debian-bookworm.tar.gz
```

Result:
`1ffae22571924ed4e7129c9e85b28a2e62f47cbaa26a9f9dfe096b510a6c8f37`

This checksum was generated from our gitian deterministic build process.

signatures](https://github.com/zcash/gitian.sigs/tree/master).

Once you've verified that it matches, extract the Bullseye or Bookworm
files and move the binaries into your executables \$PATH:

``` bash
tar -xvf zcash-6.10.0-linux64-debian-Bookworm.tar.gz

mv -t /usr/local/bin/ zcash-6.10.0/bin/*
```

Now that Zcash is installed, run this command to download the parameters
used to create and verify shielded transactions:

``` bash
zcash-fetch-params
```

Finally, [set up a configuration
file](https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/zcash_conf_guide.html)
(<span class="title-ref">~/.zcash/zcash.conf</span>) before runnning
zcashd. It can be completely empty; it will then run with the default
parameters.
